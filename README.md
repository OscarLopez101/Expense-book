# Expense-book

Welcome to your **Java + Markdown learning project**!  
This file is both a **README template** for your Netflix-style app and a **workbook** with exercises to practice Markdown and Java fundamentals.

## 📖 Overview
This project is a Java Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that allows users to track financial transactions for personal use.

## 🏗️ How It Works

When the program starts, it loads all existing transactions from transactions.csv.

The user is presented with the Home Menu where they can choose to:

Add a deposit

Make a payment

Open the ledger

Exit the program

All new transactions are immediately saved back to the CSV file to ensure data persistence.

The user can view or filter transactions and generate reports directly in the console.
